This project is my first attempt to write something following DDD and Clean Architecture. I do not have much expirience in ASP.NET, so that is also my first Â±complex project.

## Principles
- Clean Architecture
- SOLID Principles
- DRY Principle
- Domain-Driven Design

## Stack
- ASP.NET
- PostgreSQL (SQLite currently for testing) + EntityFramework
- Vue.js 3
- SignalR
